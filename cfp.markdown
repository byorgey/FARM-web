title: CFP and Paper Submission
---

There will be a formal proceedings published by ACM Press.  Accepted
papers will be included in the ACM Digital Library; see
<http://authors.acm.org/main.cfm> for information on the options
available to authors.  Authors are also encouraged to submit auxiliary
material for publication along with their paper (source code, data,
videos, images, etc.); authors retain all rights to the auxiliary
material.

We solicit submissions in two categories:

  * Full papers. A full paper is limited to 12 pages, and will be
    evaluated according to its relevance, correctness, significance,
    originality, and clarity. It should explain its contributions,
    identify what has been accomplished, explain why it is significant,
    and compare it with previous work.

  * "Aesthetic applications".  An aesthetic application paper is
    limited to 6 pages, and will be judged primarily on the effective and
    elegant use of FP to generate aesthetic artifacts (though the
    criteria for full papers are still relevant).

Submitted papers should be in portable document format (PDF),
formatted using the [ACM SIGPLAN style
guidelines](http://www.acm.org/sigs/sigplan/authorInformation.htm). The
text should be in a 9-point font in two columns.

Submissions can be made via EasyChair at <https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=farm2013>.
