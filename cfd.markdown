title: Call for Demo Proposals
---

Do you enjoy writing beautiful code to produce beautiful artifacts?
Have something cool to show off at the intersection of functional
programming and visual art, music, sound, modeling, visualization, or
design?

FARM 2013 is seeking proposals for 10-20 minute demonstrations to be
given during the workshop.  For example, a demonstration could consist
of a short tutorial, an exhibition of some work, or even a livecoding
performance. Slots for demonstrations will be shorter than slots for
accepted papers, and will not be published as part of the formal
proceedings, but can be a great way to show off interesting work and
get feedback from other workshop participants.  A demonstration slot
could be a particularly good way to get feedback on work-in-progress.

A demo proposal should consist of a 1 page abstract, in PDF format,
explaining the proposed content of the demonstration and why it would be
of interest to the attendees of FARM. Proposals will be judged on
interest and relevance to the stated goals and themes of the workshop.

Submissions can be made via EasyChair at
