title: About

The functional programming community is largely interested in writing
beautiful programs.  This workshop is intended to gather researchers
and practitioners interested in writing **beautiful programs that
generate beautiful artifacts**.  Such artifacts may include visual art,
music, 3D sculptures, animations, GUIs, video games, physical models,
architectural models, choreographies for dance, poetry, and even
physical objects such as VLSI layouts, GPU configurations, or
mechanical engineering designs.  The framework used need not be purely
functional ("mostly functional" is fine); may be based on abstractions
such as higher-order functions, monads, arrows, or streams; and may be
manifested as a domain specific language or tool.  Theoretical
foundations, language design, implementation issues, and applications
are all within the scope of the workshop.
